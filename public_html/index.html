        <h1>Minimum Enclosing Sphere Problem</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            The Minimum Enclosing Sphere problem describes trying to find a new
            point that minimizes the maximum distance to every other point.
            In real life, this can be compared to a corporation trying to place
            its new headquarters such that it is as close as possible to
            all of its branch locations. The centerpoint plus the distance to
            the furthest point(s) creates a circle in 2 dimensions or a sphere
            in greater than two dimensions. Another way to think of this problem
            is that the circle created is as small as possible while still
            encompassing every point in the set.
